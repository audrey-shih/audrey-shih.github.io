I play clarinet and piccolo (Eb) clarinet in the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, the Stanford New Ensemble, and various chamber groups. I was a 2-time concerto soloist with the Princeton University Sinfonia under Dr. Ruth Ochs, performing Claude Debussy's Premiere Rhapsodie in May 2017 and Franz Krommer's Double Clarinet Concerto in May 2018. I studied with [Jo-Ann Sternberg](https://www.juilliard.edu/music/faculty/sternberg-jo-ann) and [David Thomas](https://columbussymphony.com/musician/david-thomas/).

I had the privilege to play Eb clarinet on tour with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra through France and Monaco in June 2024. Here is a clip from Richard Strauss' *Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks*, in which the Eb clarinet depicts the main character's death by hanging at the end of the piece.
