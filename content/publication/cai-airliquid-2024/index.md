abstract: Intestinal health heavily depends on establishing a mucus layer within the
  gut with physical properties that strike a balance between being sufficiently elastic
  to keep out harmful pathogens yet viscous enough to flow and turnover the contents
  being digested. Studies investigating dysfunction of the mucus layer in the intestines
  are largely confined to animal models, which require invasive procedures to collect
  the mucus fluid. In this work, we develop a nondestructive method to study intestinal
  mucus. We use an air–liquid interface culture of primary human intestinal epithelial
  cells that exposes their apical surface to allow in situ analysis of the mucus layer.
  Mucus collection is not only invasive but also disrupts the mucus microstructure,
  which plays a crucial role in the interaction between mucus and the gut microbiome.
  Therefore, we leverage a noninvasive rheology technique that probes the mechanical
  properties of the mucus without removal from the culture. Finally, to demonstrate
  biomedical uses for this cell culture system, we characterize the biochemical and
  biophysical properties of intestinal mucus due to addition of the cytokine IL-13
  to recapitulate the gut environment of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection.
