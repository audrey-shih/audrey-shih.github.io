abstract: To date, a compromise between resolution and print speed has rendered most
  high-resolution additive manufacturing technologies unscalable with limited applications.
  By combining a reduction lens optics system for single-digit-micrometer resolution,
  an in-line camera system for contrast-based sharpness optimization, and continuous
  liquid interface production (CLIP) technology for high scalability, we introduce
  a single-digit-micrometer-resolution CLIP-based 3D printer that can create millimeter-scale
  3D prints with single-digit-micrometer-resolution features in just a few minutes.
  A simulation model is developed in parallel to probe the fundamental governing principles
  in optics, chemical kinetics, and mass transport in the 3D printing process. A print
  strategy with tunable parameters informed by the simulation model is adopted to
  achieve both the optimal resolution and the maximum print speed. Together, the high-resolution
  3D CLIP printer has opened the door to various applications including, but not limited
  to, biomedical, MEMS, and microelectronics. ,  A high-resolution CLIP 3D printer
  can rapidly and scalably fabricate 3D structures with single-digit-micrometer resolution.
