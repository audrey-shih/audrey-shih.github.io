abstract: Abstract Polymer solutions are frequently used in enhanced oil recovery
  and groundwater remediation to improve the recovery of trapped nonaqueous fluids.
  However, applications are limited by an incomplete understanding of the flow in
  porous media. The tortuous pore structure imposes both shear and extension, which
  elongates polymers; moreover, the flow is often at large Weissenberg numbers, Wi,
  at which polymer elasticity in turn strongly alters the flow. This dynamic elongation
  can even produce flow instabilities with strong spatial and temporal fluctuations
  despite the low Reynolds number, Re. Unfortunately, macroscopic approaches are limited
  in their ability to characterize the pore‐scale flow. Thus, understanding how polymer
  conformations, flow dynamics, and pore geometry together determine these nontrivial
  flow patterns and impact macroscopic transport remains an outstanding challenge.
  This review describes how microfluidic tools can shed light on the physics underlying
  the flow of polymer solutions in porous media at high Wi and low Re. Specifically,
  microfluidic studies elucidate how steady and unsteady flow behavior depends on
  pore geometry and solution properties, and how polymer‐induced effects impact nonaqueous
  fluid recovery. This work thus provides new insights for polymer dynamics, non‐Newtonian
  fluid mechanics, and applications such as enhanced oil recovery and groundwater
  remediation.
