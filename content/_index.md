        <p class="full-align-indented">Drainage of abscess fluids often fails because physicians don't have a way to predict which catheter size is suitable. I've built a low-cost, portable, sterilizable magnetic stress rheometer that can be deployed to hospitals to solve this issue. With <1 mL of a sample of abscess fluid, I can use my instrument to model the fluid and predict its drainage rate, enabling physicians to personalize treatment plans for each patient.
        
        <p class="full-align-indented">I'm also working on controlling the rheology of bioinks in 3D bioprinting to optimize biomanufactured tissues and organs. My research is supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.com/" style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>!
        <br>

        <p class="full-align-indented">During my undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://dattalab.princeton.edu/" style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Professor Sujit Datta</a> at Princeton University to understand the flow of polymer solutions in porous media, useful in cleaning up groundwater in aquifers. My junior work and senior thesis were featured in the news articles below!

        <p class="center-align">Outside of the lab, I play clarinet and piano and dabble in conducting, composing, and arranging. I love experimenting with new instruments, techniques, and styles of music. I also like making science-inspired art.
