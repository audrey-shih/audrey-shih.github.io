      subtitle: 'Exploring Innovations in 3D Bioprinting'
      text: |-
        I'm currently working to control the rheology of bioinks in 3D bioprinting, to optimize biomanufactured tissues and organs made up of precisely patterned cells. I've designed a magnetic stress rheometer (MSR) to measure the rheology of biomaterials like bioinks and abscess fluids. My research is supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.com/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>!
        <br>

        During my undergrad, I worked with <a href="https://dattalab.princeton.edu/">Professor Sujit Datta</a> at Princeton University to understand the flow of polymer solutions in porous media, useful in cleaning up groundwater in aquifers. I was featured in news articles about <a href="https://acee.princeton.edu/acee-news/people-spotlight-audrey-shih/">my junior year research</a>, and <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/06/08/senior-thesis-project-probes-intricacies-groundwater-cleanup">my senior thesis</a>!

        Outside of the lab, I play clarinet and piano and dabble in conducting, composing, and arranging. I love experimenting new instruments, techniques, and styles of music!
        
        I also like making stuff at the intersection of art and engineering. See some of my music and art projects below.
