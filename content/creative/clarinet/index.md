I play clarinet and piccolo (Eb) clarinet in the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, the Stanford New Ensemble, and various chamber groups. Last year, I played clarinet and bass clarinet in Arnold Schoenberg's *Pierrot Lunaire*. I was a 2-time concerto soloist with the Princeton University Sinfonia under Dr. Ruth Ochs, performing Claude Debussy's *Premiere Rhapsodie* in 2017 and Franz Krommer's *Double Clarinet Concerto, Op. 91* in 2018. During my time at Princeton, I was a member of the Princeton University Orchestra, Sinfonia, Chamber Music Society, Pops Orchestra, and Trenton Youth Orchestra. I studied with [Jo-Ann Sternberg](https://www.juilliard.edu/music/faculty/sternberg-jo-ann) and [David Thomas](https://columbussymphony.com/musician/david-thomas/).

I played Eb clarinet on tour with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra through France and Monaco in June 2024. Here is a clip from Richard Strauss' *Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks*, in which the Eb clarinet depicts the main character's death by hanging at the end of the piece.
