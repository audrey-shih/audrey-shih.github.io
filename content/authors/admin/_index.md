      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Hey, I'm Audrey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 5th year PhD candidate in the Chemical Engineering Department at Stanford University, working with [Professor Gerry Fuller](https://fullergroup.stanford.edu/).

My research interests include designing simple instruments to tackle complex problems in soft matter as well as leveraging physical properties of human-derived and synthetic biomaterials to diagnose diseases and innovate treatments.

**I'm looking for a research position in industry** starting the summer of 2025. Please reach out if I might be a good fit!
