      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Hey, I'm Audrey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 5th year PhD candidate in the Chemical Engineering Department at Stanford University, working with [Professor Gerry Fuller](https://fullergroup.stanford.edu/).

My research interests include designing simple instruments to tackle complex problems in rheology and soft matter, and leveraging physical properties of human-derived and synthetic biomaterials to diagnose diseases and innovate treatments. I am currently working on projects to control the rheology of bioinks in 3D bioprinting, seeking to optimize biomanufactured tissues and organs made up of precisely patterned cells. My research is supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

During my undergrad, I worked with [Professor Sujit Datta](https://dattalab.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University to understand the flow of polymer solutions in porous media, useful in cleaning up groundwater in aquifers. Read about my junior year research [here](https://acee.princeton.edu/acee-news/people-spotlight-audrey-shih/), and my senior thesis [here](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2020/06/08/senior-thesis-project-probes-intricacies-groundwater-cleanup)!

Outside of research, I play clarinets of all sizes in the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, the Stanford New Ensemble, and various chamber groups. In addition to [music performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iaTGFWpA48&list=PLrV76eiXOtDYd2zu_BR23Gu18ruqG6din), I also love dabbling in [music arranging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3rwGvBZlAI&list=PLrV76eiXOtDZWZGaaicYCJWrseJZ8eq9P&index=2), conducting, and [film scoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzqSTuFyhb4).
