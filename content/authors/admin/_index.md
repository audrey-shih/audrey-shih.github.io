## Hey, I'm Audrey ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 5th year PhD candidate in the Chemical Engineering Department at Stanford University, working with [Professor Gerry Fuller](https://fullergroup.stanford.edu/).

My current work focuses on designing simple instruments to tackle complex problems in soft matter and leveraging physical properties of human-derived and synthetic biomaterials to diagnose diseases and innovate treatments. My general interests are in soft matter, polymers, and biomaterials.

**I'm looking for a research position in industry** starting in summer 2025. Please reach out if I might be a good fit!
